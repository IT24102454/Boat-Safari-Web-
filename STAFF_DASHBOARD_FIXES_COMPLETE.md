# Staff Dashboard Issues - FIXED

## Summary of All Issues and Their Fixes

### âœ… Issue 1: Cannot Remove/Delete Current Assignments
**Problem**: The delete button (X) in Current Assignments table wasn't working
**Root Cause**: Missing backend endpoint and incomplete frontend implementation
**Fix Applied**:
1. **Backend**: Added `DELETE /api/staff/assignments/{tripId}` endpoint in StaffController
   - Unassigns boat (sets status to AVAILABLE)
   - Unassigns guide from trip
   - Updates trip in database
   - Returns success/error response

2. **Frontend**: Implemented proper `removeAssignment()` function
   - Makes DELETE request to new endpoint
   - Shows confirmation dialog
   - Handles success/error responses
   - Refreshes assignments and trips tables

### âœ… Issue 2: Error When Creating New Boat & Guide Assignment
**Problem**: "Failed to assign resources" error when clicking "Assign Resources"
**Root Cause**: Poor error handling and validation in frontend
**Fix Applied**:
1. **Improved Frontend Validation**:
   - Added check for at least one resource (boat or guide) to be selected
   - Better error message handling from backend
   - Proper integer conversion for IDs
   - Added debug logging

2. **Enhanced Backend Error Handling**:
   - More detailed error messages
   - Proper validation of trip, boat, and guide existence
   - Better handling of partial assignments (boat only or guide only)

### âœ… Issue 3: Cannot Access Edit Trip Details
**Problem**: Edit button showed placeholder alert instead of actual edit functionality
**Root Cause**: Missing edit trip modal and backend endpoints
**Fix Applied**:
1. **Backend**: Added two new endpoints in StaffController
   - `GET /api/staff/trips/{tripId}` - Fetch trip details for editing
   - `PUT /api/staff/trips/{tripId}` - Update trip details

2. **Frontend**: 
   - Added complete edit trip modal with all trip fields
   - Implemented `editTrip()` function to fetch and populate form
   - Added `updateTrip()` function to save changes
   - Proper form validation and error handling

## New Features Added

### ðŸ†• Enhanced Assignment Management
- **Remove Assignments**: Staff can now remove boat/guide assignments from trips
- **Partial Assignments**: Can assign just boat or just guide (not both required)
- **Better Validation**: Clear error messages for invalid selections

### ðŸ†• Complete Trip Editing
- **Full Trip Editor**: Edit all trip properties (name, date, time, route, capacity, price, location, description)

- **Validation**: Proper form validation with error handling

### ðŸ†• Improved User Experience
- **Better Error Messages**: Specific error messages instead of generic ones
